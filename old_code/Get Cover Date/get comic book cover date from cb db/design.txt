get comic book cover date from cb db

I'm thinking if this is to be a comic book database web site agnostic program then the cii_series (name)
field needs to be moved from the series table to the is_series_ids table

Design Doc
==========

Process
-------

1 scan issues into comic collectorz
	- fill out fields: purchase date, store, condition
2 export flat (text) flie
	- chose "invoice output" for sort fields and column
	- select all comics that do not have a owner
	- go to file --> export to --> text file
	- chose selected comics, use main screen settings, semicolon, double quotes, space
	- provide a destination file name
	- click the export button
3 process flat file with the program (see below) to generate output file with invoice data & cover date
	- $ cd /Users/gskluzacek/Documents/Development/get\ comic\ book\ cover\ date\ from\ cb\ db  
	- $ php get_cvr_dt.php -s1 > out.txt
	- $ open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app out.txt
	- look for any missing titles and add as needed...
4 open output file in excel using the file --> open (text) file, then use the text import wizzard
5 copy data to excel invoce template
6 enter comic book prices
7 update purchase price & owner in comic collectorz

Adding a new series to the database
-----------------------------------

lookup the title on http://www.comicbookdb.com and get the title name and ID

insert a record into the SERIES table
	ser_name: The name as I want the title to appear on the invoice
	ser_name_sort:	name to be used to sort by
	ser_year: the year issue number one was published
	ser_cover_price: the cover price of the comic with no discounts
	cii_series: name of the series on the comic book db web site
	
insert a record into the IS_SERIES_IDS table
	ser_id: the id for the series from the SERIES table
	is_id: 1 <-- the id for the comic book db web site
	issi_series_id: the title ID from the comic book db web site

last_insert_rowid()

program
-------

* maintian the internet_sources, series and series_ids tables as needed outside of this program
- when adding a new item to the series table: must enter both my series name and collectorz series name

insert into series (ser_name, ser_name_sort, ser_year, ser_cover_price, cii_series, crt_dt, updt_dt) 
values ('Amazing X-Men', 'amazing xmen', 2013, 3.99, 'Amazing X-Men, Vol. 2', datetime('now'), datetime('now'));

= will also need to add a corresponding record to the is_series_id table (for the newly inserted ser_id's)
  for each internet_sources record defined with the source's series id

-- Amazing X-Men
insert into is_series_ids (ser_id, is_id, issi_series_id, crt_dt, updt_dt) 
values (51, 1, 42055, datetime('now'), datetime('now'));


either pass in on the command line
- the is_id (internet source id)	- the source to process the records on the cii table
- the eh_id (execution history id)	- re-run mode, to reporcess unmatched cii records

the re-run mode will by-pass loading the collectorz invoice input file and downloading the HTML

create a new record on the execution_history table with the specified is_id

load the collectorz invoice input file into the collectorz_invoice_input table 
(with the eh_id from the newly inserted execution_history record)
-- comput the issue number by taking the cii_issue_no field and concatenate it with the
	cii_issue_ext field if the extension starts with a period, remove any space characters
	keep any numeric characters [0-9] until a non-numeric non-space character is encountered
	
	for example if issue_no is 7 and issue_ext is .1A then the calculated issue num would be 7.1
	
read the internet_sources table for the specified is_id

do a select distinct si_series_id, ser_id, cii_series
join 
from cii to ser (cii_id)
from ser to si (ser_id)
where si.is_id = specified is_id
  and cii.eh_id = this execution's eh_id

for each record returned: 
1) insert a record into the is_series_header table
2) use the si_series_id along with the is_base_url, is_series_index_page to download the HTML and parse it...

[ see "cbdb example series index page.png" for an example of the data at cb db ]
[ http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=1286 ]

for each record parsed insert it into the is_series_index table

for each record in the collectorz_invoice_input table for the ih_id
attempt to find the corresponding issue number for the series in the is_series_index table

if the issue is found then update the lookup_status to matched, else udate it with a staut of unmatched

if all issues are found then create the invoice output file by doing a

select ser.ser_name as title, ser.ser_year as year, null as notes, isi.isi_cover_date as cover_date, 
	cii.computed_issue_num as num, ser.ser_cover_price as cover_price

join 
from ser to cii (cii_id)
from ser to ish (ser_id)
from ish to isi (is_id)
where cii.eh_id & ish.eh_id = this execution's eh_id

steps for adding a series
-------------------------

after scanning UPCs into collectorz, export input file and execute the get_cvr_dt.php script
look for any Warnings about titles not being in the series table, this could be for 1 of 2 
reasons. 1) collectorz has renamed a title 2) it is the first time we've purchased the title.

if number 2 above, execute the following insert statement for each title, replacing values as needed:

insert into series (ser_name, ser_name_sort, ser_year, ser_cover_price, cii_series, crt_dt, updt_dt) 
values ('Black Widow', 'black widow', 2014, 3.99, 'Black Widow, Vol. 6', datetime('now'), datetime('now'));

ser_name:			how I want the title to appear
ser_name_sort:		sorted version of the title, all lowercase, punctuation removed
ser_year:			the year the first issue was published
ser_cover_price:	the current cover price
cii_series:			the name of the title as it appears in the export input file

for ser_name, look up the title on http://www.comicbookdb.com
note the TITLE ID, 1st issue pub date, cover price

After all titles have been inserted execute the following SQL:

select * from series order by ser_id desc;

note the ser_id for each new title

for each newly added issue execute the following SQL:

insert into is_series_ids (ser_id, is_id, issi_series_id, crt_dt, updt_dt) 
values (66, 1, 36484, datetime('now'), datetime('now'));

ser_id:				ser_id from the series table
issi_series_id:		the title ID from comicbookdb.com
is_id:				should be 1 if using comicbookdb.com
